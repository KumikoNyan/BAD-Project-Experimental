product
1. add rows on edit product doesn't work properly back-end wise
    cloned rows don't get caught by request.POST

materials
1. materials template is pretty messy, not sure whether all the elements are closed properly

orders
1. orders doesn't have add row utility
2. add orders and edit orders are currently fixed to 3 items and 2 materials per item, due to the lack of adding rows
3. does not have modals to confirm edits/deletes/adds (if we plan to add that) 
4. should probably sort completed/cancelled orders to the bottom

back-end
1. pricing calculation hasn't been implemented yet
2. decide whether to store customer entities or not

overall front-end
1. need better way of adding rows on click
2. template code is pretty messy
2. might be better to strip ids from elements that dont need them
3. lots of inline styling right now
4. not sure how to dynamically show to-be created object's ids or units (might need to manually set objects ids)
5. table heights are fixed to accommodate overflow so table rows are very large when there's only few entires
